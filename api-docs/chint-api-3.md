Chint Power Systems (CPS America)

There isn’t a glossy public REST doc like SolarEdge’s, but CPS’s FlexOM ecosystem explicitly mentions an “open API” for third-party servers on their portal materials, and references MQTT Open API / HTTP hooks in gateway docs. Chint Power Systems - North America

FlexOM Gateway supports SunSpec Modbus locally and a portal with data/alerts; materials emphasize remote O&M and “push to portal,” suggesting you can either (a) poll their cloud via that open API, or (b) read locally over Modbus/SunSpec if you ever add on-prem.
