Since your app is:

A desktop-first Electron app (technicians on 2–3 PCs).

Needs lots of grids, tables, charts, dashboards.


> Ant Design (AntD) is the sweet spot.

You get responsive layouts, tables, and form handling with almost no manual work.

Paired with recharts (or AntD’s chart integrations), you’ll have dashboard-ready visuals.

Looks professional out-of-the-box (important for SP&L).
